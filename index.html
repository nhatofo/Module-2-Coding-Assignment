                    A: XMLHttpRequest signifies an Ajax request that your code is attempting to make through the browser. Most, if not all, browsers do not support Ajax requests made through the file protocol, which is what file:///somepath specifies. Instead, the browser expects an HTTP protocol, which looks like http://somepath.

                    In order for your Ajax request to work you need to serve your web site to the browser through a server. You can deploy it on GitHub as explained in Module 1 to solve the issue. However, the easiest way of having a server while your are developing is to get a local one on your machine. This is why we are pretty much always using Browser Sync.

                    Browser Sync, among other things, provides a local server option. So, simply navigate to the root directory of your web site on your machine (either through terminal program on Mac/Linux or through CMD program on Windows) and execute the following command:
                </p>
            </div>
